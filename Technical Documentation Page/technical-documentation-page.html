            Detailing is the process of cleaning a car down to its finest details. A "detail" can range from
            a simple to wash of the outside, to full on paint correction and protection. Detailing is all
            about the nitty gritty of maintaining the aesthetic beauty of a vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Detailers also use a variety of tools and products in order to get the best shine out of any
            vehicle they touch.

        <article>
          <p>
            At its core, detailing is simply the process of cleaning a vehicle. It is called detailing
            because of the extreme attention to detail required to clean vehicles at this level. Detailing is
            a time-consuming process that cannot be sped up. Paint used on vehicles is actually quite
            sensitive, and requires great care to maintain properly. Engine bays are full of electrical
            components that could be damaged if washed improperly. Vehicle interiors are covered in fragile
            plastic and stain-prone fabrics meaning that the customer will immediately be aware of any
            wrongdoings in their vehicles interior. This is why it is known as detailing rather than simply
            cleaning.

          <p>
            To get started as a detailer, we will start with washing a vehicle's exterior. We begin with the
            exterior as it typically has the most dirt, since the exterior surfaces are those exposed to the
            elements. As you become more familiar with the process, you can determine your own workflow, but
            for the sake of this documentation, we will begin with the exterior.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first step in washing a vehicle's exterior is to give the vehicle a pre-wash rinse. We do
            this because, as mentioned previously, a vehicle's exterior is exposed to the elements. Various
            substances can collect on the surfaces of the paint such as: bird fecal matter, dead bugs, tree
            sap, among other contaminants. If we were to immediately take sponge to surface, we run the risk
            of dragging these contaminants across the paint, marring and scratching the surface. So we begin
            by giving the vehicle a thorough rinse. This is the step where a pressure washer is very useful,
            since it will help to break apart any surface contaminants and remove them without the use of a
            tool on the paint.
          </p>
          <code>
            Once the car is rinsed, we'll want to clean the wheels and tires. We do this step before cleaning
            the painted surfaces because wheels and tires require a different cleaner than just vehicle soap.
            Begin by first rinsing the wheel and tire so the surfaces are damp. Then spray cleaner on to the
            whole surface of tire and wheel. Then take your brushes and work the product into the surface.
            Rinse and repeat for all four wheels and tires.
          </code>
          <code>
            The next (optional) step is to apply an initial foaming shampoo to the vehicle. I typically do
            this with a foam cannon, which sprays pre-foamed shampoo onto the vehicle. Once the vehicle is
            coated in foam, you will want to take a detail brush and brush the foam in any difficult to reach
            places, such as the grill, emblems, door handles, and the like. Once you are done with this step,
            the soap will have worked its way down the vehicle, so you are free to rinse once again.
          </code>
          <code>
            After the foam bath, we move on to washing the vehicle by hand using the two-bucket method. The
            two-bucket method involves-as the name suggests- two buckets: one for rinsing, and for soap. Both
            buckets are filled with watter, but one will also have a glob of soap mixed in. I also recommend
            using a grit guard in the bottom of your bucket, which helps to remove dirt from your mitt, and
            keep it in the bucket, instead of back onto the vehicle. Dip your mitt into the soap bucket, and
            start by soaping up one panel at a time. Work the mitt in long, straight strokes. Between each
            panel, drop your mitt in the rinse bucket, and be sure drag the surface along the grit guard to
            loosen any dirt that may be remaining. Soap every panel of the car, and then rinse.
          </code>
          <code>
            The last step is to dry the vehicle. We use a large microfiber towel to dry the vehicle as
            microfiber is highly absorbent. Some microfiber towels can hold gallons of liquid at a time, so
            it makes drying easy. Just be sure to move your towel in long and straight strokes just like
            during the wash process. Once the vehicle is dry, we can move on to the interior!

            Now that we've finished washing the exterior of the vehicle, we can move on to the interior.
          </p>
          <code>
            An interior detail begins with the floor mats. Depending on the material of the mats, you will
            have to approach this step differently. For carpet mats, remove the mats and assess the level of
            dirt. If they are lightly to moderately dirty, vaccuum the mats, spray them with carpet solution,
            agitate the soap with a soft/medium bristled brush, and extract them with the fabric extractor.
            Make multiple passes with your extractor, spraying water down until you're extracting nothing but
            clear water. If you are still extracting soap, make another pass. Also make sure to make passes
            from multiple directions, to pull at the soap from every angle. If the mats are severely dirty,
            vaccuum what you can, then place the mats on a flat surface, spray a liberal amount of carpet
            solution, agitate with a brush, and then spray the mat with your pressure washer. Repeat as
            needed. For rubber/waterproof mats, the process more straightforward. Simply remove the mat,
            rinse with pressure washer, spray with all-purpose cleaner, agitate with a brush, and rinse with
            pressure washer once more. Repeat as needed.
          </code>
          <code>
            After the mats, we move on to the actual interior of the vehicle. The first step is to vaccuum
            the entire space. Make sure to vaccuum the crevices in the footwells and the seams of the seats.
            Move the seats forward and backward to access the space underneath the seat as well. Once the
            vehicle is sufficiently vaccuumed, move on to carpet shampooing. Working in one footwell at a
            time, spray a liberal amount of carpet solution on the carpet. Then, agitate with a brush, and
            lastly extract the carpet using your fabric extractor. Be sure to spray water until you are
            extracting clear water. Work the extractor in multiple directions to speed up this process. Don't
            oversaturate the vehicles carpeting with water, however, as you may waterlog the foam underneath.
            You can follow this same process to deep clean fabric seats as well. If you have leather seats,
            follow the directions on your leather cleaner and dresser.
          </code>
          <code>
            Once the carpets and seats have been extracted, we can move on to cleaning the surfaces of the
            vehicle. For this step you will need your all-purpose cleaner, several microfiber towels, a soft
            detail brush, your plastic restorer/protectant, and a few more microfiber towels. Begin by
            folding one of your towels into quarters, then spray your all-purpose cleaner directly into the
            towel. You spray the product directly into the towel to prevent overspray, and so that you
            control how much product you are using on a given area. Once your towel is loaded with product,
            wipe any and every plastic surface in your vehicle. If your towel starts to dry out, give it
            another spray. Work your way around the whole vehicle. If there are any tough stains or heavily
            soiled areas once you are finished with this step, first spray the area directly with your all
            purpose cleaner, then hit it with a few seconds of steam from a steam cleaner. Be careful when
            working with the steam cleaner, because you can melt a vehicle's plastics by exposing them to
            steam for too long. After you have removed the majority of the soil, you can move on to dressing
            and protecting the plastic. Using a fresh microfiber towel, once again spray your plastic
            restorer/protectant directly into the towel and apply to the plastic surfaces of the vehicle. As
            per your poduct's instructions, you will either be finished at this step, or may have to wipe the
            product clean off of the surfaces. Check with your products to find out.

            Now that you've cleaned the exterior and interior of your vehicle, its time to move on to
            finishing touches. First is to clean the glass. If your vehicle has glass, then take your waffle
            weave microfiber towel, spray one spray of glass cleaner, and clean the glass. Be sure to clean
            both sides of the glass, and if your glass edge is exposed, or if you can roll the window down,
            be sure to clean the edges of the glass as well. Repeat for all glass. After glass we move on to
            wax. Read the instructions on your particular wax to find out more about this process. Begin by
            applying 4-6 small dots of produc on a foam pad on your dual-action polisher. Next, while wearing
            a glove, spread the product around the foam pad. Apply 4-6 more dots, pat the foam pad onto the
            surface of the vehicle, turn on the polisher and begin spreading the product around. Apply a
            consistent pressure, but not too heavy. Cover the whole exterior of the vehicle in wax, wait the
            suggested amount of time as per the products instructions, and then buff off remaining product
            with a microfiber towel. Be sure that during the buffing step you replace your towel often, as
            the product will soak into the towel, and you will eventually just spread the product further,
            rather than buffing it up as intended. Once you are finished, you can dress your tires with your
            favorite tire dresser, and then you're finished!
